ABOUT

Verity maintains a database of hashes of files you feed it and shows you what content was present when.

INSTALLING

Verity was developed on Debian Linux and has not yet been compiled or tested on other systems.

To build you will need the development packages for Openssl and Postgresql's "libpq", and the "libfgetsnull" and "libhexbytes" libraries from github.com/michael-redman.

Example command for installing packaged dependencies on Debian:

root@yourhost:~# aptitude install make gcc libpq-dev postgresql

Example commands for cloning the other 2 dependencies from github:

you@yourhost:~$ git clone git://github.com/michael-redman/libfgetsnull
you@yourhost:~$ git clone git://github.com/michael-redman/libhexbytes

The two dependencies you have to build, and Verity, all build and install with the standard "make" and "make install" commands.

If the database queries in Verity cause your system to run out of memory and swap excessively, you probably need to tune Postgres to use less memory - see especially the documentation for "work_mem".  On low memory machines with many files in the data set the large join queries may still run forever, in that case try an alternate set of queries by recompiling Verity with the make option "QUERY_TYPE=CORRELATED_SUBQUERY".

Example commands for setting up database on Debian:

yourhost:~# su -l postgres
postgres@yourhost:~$ createuser you
postgres@yourhost:~$ createdb -O you my_verity_db
postgres@yourhost:~$ exit

you@yourhost:~$ psql my_verity_db < /usr/local/share/verity/schema.psql

After installing please read the further instructions, use examples, and notes on design limitations in the verity(7) manual page.

IN GOD WE TRVST.
